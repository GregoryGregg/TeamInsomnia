2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-13#1 Warning
combinational multiplier  
Detected combinational multiplier in DSP instance Surface/speedB/pwm1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.131 ns between Surface/Speedcontrol/countb_r_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and Surface/speedB/pwm_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
